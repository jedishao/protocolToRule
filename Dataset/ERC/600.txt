 Specification

We define the following 2 levels in BIP32 path:
m / purpose' / subpurpose' / EIP'

Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.
Each level has a special meaning, described in the chapters below.

 Purpose

Purpose is set to 43, as documented in this proposed change to BIP43.
The purpose field indicates that this path is for a non-bitcoin cryptocurrency.
Hardened derivation is used at this level.

 Subpurpose

Subpurpose is set to 60, the SLIP-44 code for Ethereum.
Hardened derivation is used at this level.

 EIP

EIP is set to the EIP number specifying the remainder of the BIP32 derivation path. This permits new Ethereum-focused applications of deterministic wallets without needing to interface with the BIP process.
Hardened derivation is used at this level.
