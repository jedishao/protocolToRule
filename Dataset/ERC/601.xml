<a href="#specification" class="anchor-link"></a> Specification
</h2>
<p>We define the following 4 levels in BIP32 path:</p>
<pre>m / purpose' / subpurpose' / EIP' / wallet'
</pre>
<p>Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.</p>
<p>Each level has a special meaning, described in the chapters below.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">
<a href="#purpose" class="anchor-link"></a> Purpose
</h3>
<p>Purpose is a constant set to 43, indicating the key derivation is for a non-bitcoin cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="subpurpose">
<a href="#subpurpose" class="anchor-link"></a> Subpurpose
</h3>
<p>Subpurpose is set to 60, the SLIP-44 code for Ethereum.</p>
<p>Hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="eip">
<a href="#eip" class="anchor-link"></a> EIP
</h3>
<p>EIP is set to the EIP number specifying the remainder of the BIP32 derivation path. For paths following this EIP specification, the number assigned to this EIP is used.</p>
<p>Hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="wallet">
<a href="#wallet" class="anchor-link"></a> Wallet
</h3>
<p>This component of the path splits the wallet into different user identities, allowing a single wallet to have multiple public identities.</p>
<p>Accounts are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner. This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.</p>
<p>Hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<p>Software should prevent a creation of an account if a previous account does not have a transaction history (meaning its address has not been used before).</p>
<p>Software needs to discover all used accounts after importing the seed from an external source.</p>
