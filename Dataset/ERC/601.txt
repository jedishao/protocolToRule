 Specification

We define the following 4 levels in BIP32 path:
m / purpose' / subpurpose' / EIP' / wallet'

Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.
Each level has a special meaning, described in the chapters below.

 Purpose

Purpose is a constant set to 43, indicating the key derivation is for a non-bitcoin cryptocurrency.
Hardened derivation is used at this level.

 Subpurpose

Subpurpose is set to 60, the SLIP-44 code for Ethereum.
Hardened derivation is used at this level.

 EIP

EIP is set to the EIP number specifying the remainder of the BIP32 derivation path. For paths following this EIP specification, the number assigned to this EIP is used.
Hardened derivation is used at this level.

 Wallet

This component of the path splits the wallet into different user identities, allowing a single wallet to have multiple public identities.
Accounts are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner. This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.
Hardened derivation is used at this level.
Software should prevent a creation of an account if a previous account does not have a transaction history (meaning its address has not been used before).
Software needs to discover all used accounts after importing the seed from an external source.
