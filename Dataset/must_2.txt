This function transfers an amount of tokens from a user address to an ERC721 token. This function MUST ensure that the recipient contract implements ERC721 using the ERC165 supportsInterface function. This function SHOULD ensure that the recipient token actually exists, by calling ownerOf on the recipient token’s contract, and ensuring it neither throws nor returns the zero address. This function MUST emit the TransferToParent event upon a successful transfer (in addition to the standard ERC20 Transfer event!). This function MUST throw if the _from account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

For backwards-compatibility, implementations MUST emit the standard ERC20 Transfer event when a transfer occurs, regardless of whether the sender and recipient are addresses or ERC721 tokens. In the case that either sender or recipient are tokens, the corresponding parameter in the Transfer event SHOULD be the contract address of the token.

Successful completion of this method MUST emit an Approval event (defined below) unless the caller is attempting to clear approval when there is no pending approval. In particular, an Approval event MUST be fired if the _to address is zero and there is some outstanding approval. Additionally, an Approval event MUST be fired if _to is already the currently approved address and this call otherwise has no effect. (i.e. An approve() call that “reaffirms” an existing approval MUST fire an event.)

Assigns the ownership of quantity MCFT’s with ID _classId to _to if and only if quantity == balanceOf(msg.sender, _classId). A successful transfer MUST fire the Transfer event (defined below).
A conforming contract MUST allow the current owner to “transfer” a token to themselves, as a way of affirming ownership in the event stream. (i.e. it is valid for _to == msg.sender if balanceOf(msg.sender, _classId) >= balance.)

If the Provider supports Ethereum RPC subscriptions, e.g. eth_subscribe, the Provider MUST emit the message event when it receives a subscription notification.
If the Provider receives a subscription message from e.g. an eth_subscribe subscription, the Provider MUST emit a message event with a ProviderMessage object of the following form:
If the Provider becomes connected, the Provider MUST emit the event named connect.
If the Provider becomes disconnected from all chains, the Provider MUST emit the event named disconnect with value error: ProviderRpcError, per the interfaced defined in the RPC Errors section. The value of the error’s code property MUST follow the status codes for CloseEvent.
If the Provider becomes disconnected from all chains, the Provider MUST emit the event named disconnect with value error: ProviderRpcError, per the interfaced defined in the RPC Errors section. The value of the error’s code property MUST follow the status codes for CloseEvent.

Resolvers MUST emit this event on each change to the address for a name and coin type.
When emitting the ConsecutiveTransfer event the Transfer event MUST NOT be emitted

For all addresses spender, uint256s tokenId, deadline, and nonce, and bytes sig, a call to permit(spender, tokenId, deadline, sig) MUST set spender as approved on tokenId as long as the owner of tokenId remains in possession of it, and MUST emit a corresponding Approval event, if and only if the following conditions are met:
