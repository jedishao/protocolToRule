</h2>
<p>The current ‚Äúfirst price auction‚Äù fee model in Ethereum is inefficient and needlessly costly to users. This EIP proposes a way to replace this with a mechanism that allows dynamically priced transaction fees and efficient transaction price discovery.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">
<a href="#abstract" class="anchor-link"></a> Abstract
</h2>
<p>Based on <a href="https://agoric.com/papers/incentive-engineering-for-computational-resource-management/full-text/">The Agoric Papers</a>.</p>
<p>Each transaction would have the option of providing parameters that specify an ‚Äúescalating‚Äù bid, creating a time-based auction for validators to include that transaction.</p>
<p>This creates highly efficient price discovery, where the price will always immediately fall to the highest bid price, which is not necessarily that user‚Äôs highest price they would pay.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">
<a href="#motivation" class="anchor-link"></a> Motivation
</h2>
<p>Ethereum currently prices transaction fees using a simple first-price auction, which leads to well documented inefficiencies (some of which are documented in <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md">EIP-1559</a>) when users are trying to estimate what price will get a transaction included in a block, especially during times of price volatility and full blocks.</p>
<p>EIP 1559 is currently being championed as an improvement for the Ethereum protocol, and while I agree that the gas market is very inefficient, since a change like this will affect all client and wallet implementations, the Ethereum community should make sure to make a selection based on solid reasoning and justifications, which I believe 1559 is currently lacking.</p>
<p>To facilitate a more productive and concrete discussion about the gas fee market, I felt it was important to present an alternative that is clearly superior to the status quo, so that any claimed properties of EIP-1559 can be compared to a plausible alternative improvement.</p>
<p>I suggest the three gas payment algorithms be compared under all combinations of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks that are regularly half full, Blocks that are regularly less than half full, and blocks that repeatedly full in a surprising (‚Äúblack swan‚Äù) series.</li>
<li>Users that are willing to wait for a price that may be below the market rate, vs users who value inclusion urgently and are willing to pay above market rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We should then ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the user willing to pay the most in a given scenario also likely to have their transaction processed in a time period they find acceptable?</li>
<li>Are users who want a good price likely to get included in a reasonable period of time? (Ideally within one block)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that under this analysis we will find that the escalator algorithm outperforms EIP-1559 in both normal and volatile conditions, for both high-stakes transactions and more casual users looking for a good price.</p>
<p>While I think a deeper simulation/analysis should be completed, I will share my expected results under these conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by introducing tx fee payment related to the current time, we create an incentive for miners to more honestly report the current time.</p>

<p>Now I will consider the ultimate results of the strategies listed above. Are users happy under these conditions? Did we save users money? Were users who wanted urgent inclusion able to secure it?</p>

</table>
<p>In all cases, the escalator algorithm as I have described is able to perform optimally.</p>
<p>The current gas auction model works well under half-full and less conditions, but for users with urgent needs, has the downside of overpayment. For users seeking a low price, the current model has the downside of requiring re-submission, but has the benefit of always giving users a path towards reliable block inclusion.</p>
<p>EIP-1559 also performs well under normal conditions, but under conditions where blocks are regularly full, the price discovery mechanism breaks, and miners will fall back to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TIP</code> parameter to choose the transactions to include, meaning that under network congestion, EIP-1559 forces users to <em>either</em> choose efficient prices or certainty of next-block inclusion.</p>
<p>EIP-1559 also has all the re-submission issues of the current model in situations where a user would like to pay under the current market rate, but has certain time constraints limiting their patience. The Escalator algorithm is the only strategy listed here that allows users to discover the lowest possible price given the network conditions and their time constraints.</p>

</h2>
<p><strong>Client-Wide Parameters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INITIAL_FORK_BLKNUM</code>: TBD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transaction Parameters</strong>
The transaction <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gasPrice</code> parameter is now optional, and if excluded can be replaced by these parameters instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">START_PRICE</code>: The lowest price that the user would like to pay for the transaction.</li>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">START_TIME</code>: The first time that this transaction is valid at.</li>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAX_PRICE</code>: The maximum price the sender would be willing to pay to have this transaction processed.</li>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAX_TIME</code>: The time at which point the user‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAX_PRICE</code> is achieved. The transaction remains valid after this time at that price.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>For all blocks where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block.number &gt;= INITIAL_FORK_BLKNUM</code>:</p>
<p>When processing a transaction with the new pricing parameters, miners now receive a fee based off of the following linear function, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BLOCK</code> is the current block number:</p>
<ul>
<li>IF <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BLOCK &gt; MAX_TIME</code> then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TX_FEE = MAX_PRICE</code>.</li>
<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TX_FEE = START_PRICE + ((MAX_PRICE - START_PRICE) / (MAX_TIME - START_TIME) * (BLOCK - START_TIME))</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">
<a href="#backwards-compatibility" class="anchor-link"></a> Backwards Compatibility
</h2>
<p>Since a current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gasPrice</code> transaction is effectively a flat-escalated transaction bid, it is entirely compatible with this model, and so there is no concrete requirement to deprecate current transaction processing logic, allowing cold wallets and hardware wallets to continue working for the foreseeable future.</p>
