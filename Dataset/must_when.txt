If a contract dynamically changes its interface and relies on the <a href="/EIPS/eip-165">ERC-165</a> cache of the <a href="/EIPS/eip-820">ERC-820</a> registry, the cache MUST be updated manually—there is no automatic cache invalidation or cache update. Ideally the contract SHOULD automatically update the cache when changing its interface. However anyone MAY update the cache on the contract’s behalf.
../Dataset/Raw-data/820.xml
If a contract implements the interface (interfaceHash) for a given address (addr), it MUST return ERC820_ACCEPT_MAGIC when called with the addr and the interfaceHash. If it does not implement the interfaceHash for a given address (addr), it MUST NOT return ERC820_ACCEPT_MAGIC.
../Dataset/Raw-data/998.xml
For backwards-compatibility, implementations MUST emit the standard ERC20 Transfer event when a transfer occurs, regardless of whether the sender and recipient are addresses or ERC721 tokens. In the case that either sender or recipient are tokens, the corresponding parameter in the Transfer event SHOULD be the contract address of the token.

<li>Even in a non-safe API and/or hybrid standards case the above event rules MUST still be adhered to when minting/creating or burning/destroying.</li>
../Dataset/Raw-data/1155.xml
The requirement to emit TransferSingle or TransferBatch on balance change implies that a valid implementation of ERC-1155 redeploying to a new contract address MUST emit events from the new contract address to replicate the deprecated contract final state. It is valid to only emit a minimal number of events to reflect only the final balance and omit all the transactions that led to that state. The event emit requirement is to ensure that the current state of the contract can always be traced only through events. To alleviate the need to emit events when changing contract address, consider using the proxy pattern, such as described in <a href="/EIPS/eip-2535">EIP-2535</a>. This will also have the added benefit of providing a stable contract address for users.

Successful completion of this method MUST emit an Approval event (defined below) unless the caller is attempting to clear approval when there is no pending approval. In particular, an Approval event MUST be fired if the _to address is zero and there is some outstanding approval. Additionally, an Approval event MUST be fired if _to is already the currently approved address and this call otherwise has no effect. (i.e. An approve() call that “reaffirms” an existing approval MUST fire an event.)

In order to prevent a malicious client from causing unintended effects when making transactions using CCIP read, contracts MUST implement appropriate checks on the extraData returned to them in the callback. Any sanity/permission checks performed on input data for the initial call MUST be repeated on the data passed through the extraData field in the callback. For example, if a transaction should only be executable by an authorised account, that authorisation check MUST be done in the callback; it is not sufficient to perform it with the initial call and embed the authorised address in the extraData.

Clever ways to minimise on-chain state updating of the deposit balances for each user and the reward balances of each holder, can help further to minimise the gas costs when sending in a batch if the batch is ordered beforehand. For example, can avoid the checks if the next NFT in the batch is the same. This left to the tip token contract implementer. Whatever optimisation is applied, it MUST still allow information of which account tipped which account and for what NFT to be reconstructed from the Tip and the TipBatch events emitted.
../Dataset/Raw-data/4393.xml
Though it is RECOMMENDED that users’ deposits are kept locked in the tip token contract or external escrow account, and SHOULD NOT be used for anything but the rewards for holders, this cannot be enforced. This standard stipulates that the rewards MUST be available for when holders withdraw their rewards from the pool of deposits.

Use of subscription tokens is in effect an indirect way to control the lifetime of an NFT. As such it is assumed that this arrangement would work best when the NFTs and subscription token contracts subscribing to the NFTs, are deployed by the same platform or decentralised app. It MUST NOT have an impact or dependencies to existing NFTs that have not approved the subscription token as an operator. Indeed in this case, any other parties wouldn’t be aware of and any NFT lifetime dependencies will be ignored, hence should not work anyway. To this end, this proposal specifies that the ‘nft’ MUST have approved the subscriptionToken contract address as operator.

It is also to update the owner amount and directly add the recipient address to the FR cycle. When overriding the _transfer function, the smart contract SHALL consider the NFT as sold for 0 ETH, and update the state accordingly after a successful transfer. This is to prevent FR circumvention.
